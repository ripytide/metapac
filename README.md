# metapac

multi-backend declarative package manager

`metapac` allows you to maintain a consistent set of packages across
multiple machines. It also makes setting up a new system with your
preferred packages from your preferred package managers much easier.

## Installation

### Cargo

```shell
cargo install metapac
```

### Arch User Repository

```shell
paru -S metapac
```

## Meta

`metapac` is a meta package manager, that means it does not directly
implement the functionality to install packages on your system, instead it
provides a standardised interface for installing packages from other
package managers. See the [Supported Backends](#supported-backends) section
for a list of the currently supported backend package managers.

## Declarative

`metapac` is also a declarative package manager, that means that you
declare in `.toml` group files the packages you would like installed on
your system and then run one of the `metapac` commands which read these
group files and then operate on your system to do some function such as
install packages in your group files that are not present on your system
yet (`metapac sync`), or remove packages present on your system but not in
your group files (`metapac clean`).

The group files are then stored with your other system configuration files
and so can be tracked with version control.

## Usage

### Enable backends

By default all backends are disabled. Enable the backends you want
`metapac` to manage by adding them to the `enabled_backends` config in
`metapac`'s config file. See the [`Config`](#config) section for more
details.

### Migrating a default system into `metapac`

Run `metapac unmanaged` and save the output into a group file in
`metapac`'s `groups/` folder, see the [`Group Files`](#group-files)
section for the exact location of this folder on your operating system.

For example, on linux this would mean:

```console
mkdir -p ~/.config/metapac/groups
metapac unmanaged > ~/.config/metapac/groups/all.toml
```

Now `metapac` won't try to remove any of your explicitly installed packages
when you run `metapac clean`.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you run `metapac clean` without first configuring your group files
> with the packages you want installed then `metapac` will attempt to
> remove all of your packages from your `enabled_backends`.
>
> `metapac clean` will always show you which packages it intends to remove
> and ask for confirmation, so make sure to double check that the expected
> packages are being removed before confirming.

### Adding a new package

1. Edit your group files with a text editor to add the package to an
   existing group file or create a new group file and add the package to
   it. See the [`Group Files`](#group-files) section for the group file
   syntax
2. Run the `metapac add` command, see `metapac add --help` for arguments
3. Run the `metapac install` command, see `metapac install --help` for
   arguments

After the first two options you will then need to run `metapac sync` for
the newly added package to be installed, whereas for `metapac install` it
also installs the package while adding it to a group file.

> [!TIP]
> The first option is recommended since then you can group or organize the
> order of packages in your group files in a way that is meaningful to you
> and even add comments using the `toml` format.

### Removing a package

Do the opposite of [`Adding a new package`](#adding-a-new-package). The
opposite of `metapac add` is `metapac remove`, the opposite of `metapac
install` is `metapac uninstall` and the opposite of `metapac sync` is
`metapac clean`.

### Hooks

There are two hooks that allow you to run a custom command before and after
`metapac` installs your package: `before_install` and `after_install`.
These hooks are configured on a per-package basis. One use-case for `arch`
packages is to enable a package's `systemd` service after it is installed.
This means you can declaratively maintain your enabled `systemd` services.
See the [`Group Files`](#group-files) section for some examples.

> [!WARNING]
> A package's hooks are only run when the package is installed by
> `metapac`. If a package is already installed then running `metapac sync`
> will not run the hooks since it will not have to install the package. You
> can uninstall the package and then re-install it using `metapac sync`
> ensure the hooks are run.

### Advanced usage

For more advanced usage read through the remaining sections, especially the
[`Config`](#config) section. You can also run `metapac --help` to get a
list of all of the available commands.

### Package Groups

Arch has two special types of packages called meta packages and package
groups. (See
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Meta_package_and_package_group>).
`metapac` only supports meta packages in group files since they are "real"
packages whereas groups are not "real". This is because meta packages are
normal PKGBUILD files with no content of themselves but which have several
dependencies, whereas package groups are special cases that don't have a
corresponding PKGBUILD file. For example, running `pacman -Si nerd-fonts`
returns "error: package 'nerd-fonts' was not found".

If you still want the behavior of a meta package you have two options.

Firstly, consider creating your own meta package with the same packages as
the group. Consider also publishing this package to the AUR so other users
can also benefit from it. Convention has it that meta packages end in
`-meta`, for example, the meta package version of `nerd-fonts` might be
called `nerd-fonts-meta` (Although `nerd-fonts-meta` does not yet exist at
the time of writing, 2025-09-03).

Alternatively, you could create a new group file using the packages from
the package group, which you can get from the command: `pacman -Sgq
<group_name>`.

### apt

### brew

### bun

### cargo

### dnf

### flatpak

### npm

If on linux you might need to first run `npm config set prefix ~/.local`.

### pipx

### pnpm

You might need to first run `pnpm setup`.

### scoop

`scoop` doesn't differentiate between implicit and explicit packages.
Therefore, you will need to list all packages and their dependencies in
your group files. See
<https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/issues/4276>.

## Config

```toml
# metapac's config.toml file (like this one) should be placed in the following location
# dependent on the operating system as specified in the `dirs` crate:
# | Platform | Value                                                 | Example                                                      |

## Group Files

```toml
# metapac's group files (like this one) should be placed in the following location
# dependent on the operating system as specified in the `dirs` crate:
# | Platform | Value                                     | Example                                                  |

# | macOS    | $HOME/Library/Application Support/groups/ | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/metapac/groups/ |
# | Windows  | {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\groups\         | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\metapac\groups\           |
#
# The packages for each backend in group files can come in two formats, short-form
# and long-form:
#
# short-form syntax is simply a string of the name of the package.
#
# long-form syntax is a table which contains several fields which can
# optionally be set to specify install options on a per-package basis.
# The "package" field in the table specifies the name of the package.
#
# For example, the following two packages are equivalent:
# arch = [
#  "metapac",
#  { package = "metapac" }
# ]

## Wishlist

Here is a list of package managers we would like to support along with any
reasons why we can't yet if any. Feel free to add to this list if you know
of any other package managers we should be aware of.
