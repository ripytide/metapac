## Unreleased

### Changed

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking Change ‚ÄºÔ∏è `arch` group files now no longer accept package
  groups. See the [`arch`](https://github.com/ripytide/metapac#arch)
  section part of the `README.md` for why the functionality was removed,
  and what to do instead. (#133)
- ‚ùó Breaking Change ‚ùó Enabled backends will now hard error if you have
  invalid packages in your group files whereas before this was just a
  warning. Not all backends can tell which packages are valid or invalid
  yet, so only the `arch` backend does this so far. But I'm planning on
  adding this validation to at least the `scoop` backend at some point and
  possibly more. (#133)
- ‚ùó Breaking Change ‚ùó The `flatpak` backend now only lists applications
  and not runtimes since runtimes are only ever dependencies to
  applications and so are intrinsically implicit packages. (#134)

### Fixed

- Cancelling a `metapac install` or `metapac uninstall` before installing
  the packages now does not change your group files. Reported in #130,
  fixed in #135.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-09

This release marks the final big part of `metapac` that has now been
implemented: updating packages! There are four core mechanisms that make up
a package manager:

- install a package
- uninstall a package
- list installed packages
- update a package

`metapac` now implements all of these key mechanisms for all our
supported backends!

> [!WARNING]
> There are very high chances that the update implementations
> for most of the backends don't actually work yet. This is simply because
> I don't have the time or energy required to fully test every different
> backend's update commands, especially since lots of the package managers
> only work on a specific linux distro!
>
> Therefore, I've tried my best for each backend and I am going to
> crowdsource the rest of the testing to the users. So as usual, if a
> backend is not behaving as you would expect, please file a bug report.
> Ideally, you can also try to find the issue with the commands so we can
> fix them.

### Added

- New subcommand `metapac update`! (#113)
- New subcommand `metapac update-all`! (#113)
- New `--locked` option for the `cargo` backend, including a new config:
  `cargo_default_locked` (#104), thanks @DominicD!.

### Changed

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking Change ‚ÄºÔ∏è Backend specific configs have been moved into
  sections for each backend and `flatpak_default_systemwide` has been
  renamed to `flatpak.systemwide` (#117), thanks @steven-omaha! For
  example:

  ```toml
  # instead of this
  arch_package_manager = "paru"
  flatpak_default_systemwide = false
  vscode_variant = "code"

  # do this
  [arch]
  package_manager = "paru"
  [flatpak]
  # notice this is now just systemwide and not default_systemwide
  systemwide = false
  [vscode]
  variant = "code"
  ```

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking Change ‚ÄºÔ∏è The `clean-cache` command and the new `update`
  command now do 3 different things depending on what you pass to the
  `--backends` option if anything:
  - if no backends are passed then the enabled_backend config is used
  - if "all" is passed by itself then all backends are used
  - otherwise the list will be parsed as a list of backends to be used

### Fixed

- For commands that take a list of packages as an option, the `--packages`
  option is now required and has a `num_args=1..` so not passing at least
  one package is a clap error. (#113)

## [0.4.1] - 2025-08-02

### Added

- Added the `scoop` backend (#101), thanks @jsfr!

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with packages being added twice when the backend didn't yet
  exist in a group file with the `metapac add` command. Fixed in #99,
  thanks @DominicD!
- Fixed a bug when running `metapac sync --no_confirm` with the `arch`
  backend. Used the incorrect `--no_confirm` option rather than
  `--noconfirm`. Fixed in #105.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-27

Another big release üö¢, with no breaking changes this time üéâüéâ. In this
release we welcome the javascript ecosystem of package managers into
`metapac`. With an exception for no `deno` support yet since it doesn't yet
support listing global packages (see
<https://github.com/denoland/deno/discussions/28230>)

### Added

- Added the `bun` backend (#95)
- Added the `npm` backend (#95)
- Added the `pnpm` backend (#95)
- Added the `yarn` backend (#95)
- Added a wishlist section to the documentation for listing package
  managers we might want to one day support
- Added relevant XKCDs to the readme since it feels like a right of passage
  and to not show them would be worse

## [0.3.2] - 2025-07-17

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with packages not being set to be explicitly installed if
  they were previously installed as a dependency (reported in #93,
  introduced by #87, fixed in #94).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-07-13

### Removed

- I managed to make it about 30 minutes after releasing `v0.3.0` before
  realizing that the `before_uninstall` and `after_uninstall` hooks were
  completely useless since to uninstall a package your remove it from you
  group files in which case there will be no hooks to execute! These hooks
  have now been removed (#92).

## [0.3.0] - 2025-07-13

This is the biggest release `metapac` has had in quite a while including
two breaking changes that will require changes to most people's config and
group files. As such I've bumped the minor version number. And so begins
the `0.3.x` journey for `metapac` :ship: and farewell `0.2.x` :wave:

### Added

- ü™ùHooksü™ù: Per-package custom commands: `before_install`,
  `after_install`, `before_uninstall` and `after_uninstall` have been
  added. This allows the automatic enabling of `systemd` services for arch
  packages by using the `after_install` hook. See the `README.md` for
  examples (#91).

### Changed

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking Change ‚ÄºÔ∏è the config `disabled_backends` has now been
  inverted and renamed to `enabled_backends` to prevent everything being
  uninstalled when adding new backends (#90).
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Breaking Change ‚ÄºÔ∏è the toml format for group files has been changed,
  options have been moved under a key called `options` in order to make way
  for the new per-package `hooks` feature (#91).
  - For example, instead of `{ package = "metapac", backend_relevant_option
= "yes"}` you should change this to `{ package = "metapac", options = {
 backend_relevant_option = "yes" } }`

### Fixed

- `metapac` will now throw errors if it encounters unexpected keys when
  deserializing config and group files. This prevents accidentally
  misspelling a config option and then being confused by `metapac` not
  respecting it (#91).
- A warning is now given to the user if duplicate packages are found in the
  same group file as well as across multiple group files (#91).
- A warning is now also given if duplicate packages are passed on the
  command line with the add/remove/install/uninstall commands (#91).

## [0.2.14] - 2025-06-04

### Fixed

- The `pipx` backend could would fail to uninstall multiple packages. This
  has been fixed in (#88), thanks @arutonee1!

## [0.2.13] - 2025-06-03

### Fixed

- The `arch` backend would sometimes attempt to reinstall already installed
  packages. This has been fixed in (#87), thanks @arutonee1!

## [0.2.12] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- The `pamac` arch package manager as another option for the `arch` backend (#84).

## [0.2.11] - 2025-05-21

### Added

- The `snap` backend now accepts a per-package `confinement` option (#82)
  thanks @curetheopensource!

### Removed

- The release notes on GitHub will no longer contain release artifacts as
  `cargo-dist` seems to have become unmaintained and has various issues at
  the moment.
- This also means that the `metapac-bin` AUR package will receive no more
  updates as it relies upon having a built artifact hosted by GitHub. The
  non-binary `metapac` AUR package will still receive updates though.

## [0.2.10] - 2025-03-22

### Added

- New backend: `vscode`, comes with a new config option: `vscode_variant`
  for selecting between VSCode and VSCodium (#78)!

## [0.2.9] - 2025-03-16

### Added

- New backend: `uv` (#75)!

### Changed

- All commands that previously took a `--package` argument now take a
  `--packages` argument instead to allow passing multiple packages instead
  of just one at a time.

### Removed

- The `rustup` backend has been removed since `rustup` components are more
  complex to manage and so don't fit with the rest of the backends very
  nicely. (#76)

## [0.2.8] - 2025-03-09

### Added

- New commands (#71):
  - `metapac remove` which is the opposite of `metapac add`
  - `metapac install` which does `metapac add` plus immediately installs
    the requested package
  - `metapac uninstall` which does the opposite of `metapac install`

### Removed

- The `metapac review` command has been removed since it hasn't had an
  implementation and has been replaced by editing the output of the
  `metapac unmanaged` command using a text editor as outlined in the usage
  section of the `README.md`.

## [0.2.7] - 2025-02-08

### Fixed

- `flatpak` backend now doesn't skip the first listed package (#65) thanks
  @latin-1!
- `dnf` backend now queries installed packages using the correct format
  (it was missing a newline between packages) (#66) thanks @latin-t!

### Changed

- There is quite a large code refactor for each of the backends in this
  release, there shouldn't be any functional differences from the last
  version but there is a higher likelihood for new bugs to be introduced.

## [0.2.6] - 2024-12-23

### Added

- A new per-package `systemwide` setting for `flatpak` packages. (#62)

### Changed

- The `flatpak_systemwide` has been renamed to
  `flatpak_default_systemwide` to allow for a new `systemwide`
  per-package setting for `flatpak` packages (#62)

### Removed

- The `optional_deps` options on `arch` packages has been removed
  since it not a feature of the `arch` backend package managers and
  was handled by `metapac`, in the interest of simplicity this odd bit
  of logic has been removed (this also it makes the
  code nicer). Instead if you have multiple packages
  which you want installed only if another package is installed
  consider using a comment and whitespace to separate them
  visually in your group files so that it is obvious when reading or
  modififying them that they are linked. You could even separate the
  packages out into another group file and include or uninclude the
  entire group via symlinking or the `hostname_groups` config feature. (#62)

### Fixed

- The `flatpak` backend no longer mistakenly uses `sudo` when removing packages. (#57)

## [0.2.5] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- New backend: `snap` (#54) thanks @watzon!

## [0.2.4] - 2024-11-21

### Added

- New subcommand `metapac backends`! (#50)

  A new subcommand `metapac backends` has been added which shows you which
  backends `metapac` can find on your system and also their version
  numbers!

- `flatpak` packages now support a `remote` config value to allow you to
  specify which remote you want to install each package from (#53)

### Fixed

- `metapac` now gives out a hefty warning when you have arch packages in
  your group files which don't match real arch packages in the `arch` package
  repositories (#52). Here is an example of the warning:

  ```
  WARN  metapac::backends::arch > arch package "mesa-vdpau" was not found as an available package and so was ignored (you can test
  if the package exists via `pacman -Si "mesa-vdpau"` or similar command using your chosen AUR helper)

  it may be due to one of the following issues:
    - the package name has a typo as written in your group files
    - the package is a virtual package (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Virtual_packages)
      and so is ambiguous. You can run `pacman -Ss "mesa-vdpau"` to list non-virtual packages which
      which provide the virtual package
    - the package was removed from the repositories
    - the package was renamed to a different name
    - the local package database is out of date and so doesn't yet contain the package:
      update it with `sudo pacman -Sy` or similar command using your chosen AUR helper
  ```
