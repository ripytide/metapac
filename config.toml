# metapac's config.toml file (like this one) should be placed in the following location
# dependent on the operating system as specified in the `dirs` crate:
# | Platform | Value                                                 | Example                                                      |
# | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
# | Linux    | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/metapac/config.toml | /home/alice/.config/metapac/config.toml                      |
# | macOS    | $HOME/Library/Application Support/metapac/config.toml | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/metapac/config.toml |
# | Windows  | {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\metapac\config.toml         | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\metapac\config.toml           |

# Backends to enable for most of metapac's behavior. See the README.md or
# run `metapac backends` for the list of backend names
# Default: []
enabled_backends = ["arch"]

# Whether to use the [hostname_groups] config table to decide which
# group files to use or to use all files in the groups folder.
# Default: false
hostname_groups_enabled = true

# Which group files apply for which hostnames
# paths starting without a / are relative to the groups folder
# Default: None
[hostname_groups]
pc = ["example_group"]
laptop = ["example_group"]
server = ["example_group"]

[arch]
# Since pacman, pamac, paru, pikaur and yay all operate on the same package database
# they are mutually exclusive and so you must pick which one you want
# metapac to use.
# Must be one of: ["pacman", "pamac", "paru", "pikaur", "yay"]
# Default: "pacman"
package_manager = "paru"

[cargo]
# Whether to default to installing cargo packages with the --locked option.
# Default: false
locked = true

[flatpak]
# Whether to default to installing flatpak packages systemwide or for the
# current user. This setting can be overridden on a per-package basis.
# Default: true
systemwide = true

[mise]
# Backends that mise should manage (delegate to mise). Example: ["npm", "pipx"].
# Default: [] (no delegation). Itâ€™s fine to enable the `mise` backend at the
# same time; the `mise` section will only show non-delegated tools while
# delegated providers remain grouped under their native backends.

[vscode]
# Since VSCode and VSCodium both operate on the same package database
# they are mutually exclusive and so you must pick which one you want
# metapac to use.
# Must be one of: ["code", "codium"]
# Default: "code"
