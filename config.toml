# The pacdef config.toml file is expected in the
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pacdef directory (usually ~/.config/pacdef/config.toml)
# unless using the --config-dir cli option.

# To decide which group files are relevant for the current machine
# pacdef uses the machine's hostname in the hostname_groups table in
# the config file to get a list of group file names.

# Since pacman, yay and paru all operate on the same package database
# they are mutally exclusive and so you must pick which one you want
# pacdef to use.
# Examples include: "pacman", "paru", "yay"
# Default: "pacman"

# Extra arguments passed to pacman when removing an arch package.
# Default: []

# Whether to install flatpak packages systemwide or for the current user.
# Default: true

# Backends to disable from all pacdef behavior. See the README.md for
# the list of backend names
# Default: []

# Whether to use the [hostname_groups] config table to decide which
# group files to use or to use all files in the groups folder.
# Default: false

# Which group files apply for which hostnames
# paths starting without a / are relative to the groups folder
